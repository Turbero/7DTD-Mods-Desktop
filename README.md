# 7DTD-Mods-Desktop

7DTD Mods Desktop is a free open-source tool to allow all users to create modded content without getting to know about the vanilla game implementation files, or as least as possible in the worst case.

With this in mind, I organised this tool in several sections that anybody can investigate and use to create modded content. The main highlights are:

MODDING TOOLS
- Built-In Modding
- Zombies Configuration
- Mods Organiser
- Quest Generator

UTILITIES
- Vanilla Viewer
- Horde Calendar
- Perks Books History

Please feel free to access this simple website I also created and host with full details about how each of them works:

# Installation Requirements

There are only two basic requirements to use the tool:
- 7 Days To Die game Alpha latest version (I cannot ensure backward compatibility because the game evolves constantly)
- Java 1.6.0 or higher. It can be installed from here: https://www.java.com/

Also recommendable to run in a folder without admin permission needed. For example at your desktop: C:\Users\<youruser>\Desktop.

# Troubleshooting

Please bear in mind that the game does NOT have a meaningful support for troubleshooting and the logs are not very useful if you create some wrong content, but I have tried to minimise this as much as possible so users are not impacted. In fact, if some content is about to be created wrongly the desktop won't let you create it (for example when generating wrong content with the Quest Generator).

If the console game shows red errors, please review your generated content and look up typos. Otherwise I'll be more than willing to help.

Feel free to use the issue tracker to raise any problems I'll fix them up as soon as I can: https://github.com/Turbero/7DTD-Mods-Desktop/issues (GitHub account needed).
